Abdelzaher Professor and Willett Faculty Scholar Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Urbana, IL 61801 Tel: (217) 265-6793 Fax: (217) 244-6500 I received my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, in 1999, under Professor Kang Shin . I was an Asistant Professor at the University of Virginia from August 1999 to August 2005. I then joined the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign as an Associate Professor with tenure, where I became Full Professor in 2011. My interests lie primarily in systems, including operating systems, networking, sensor networks, distributed systems, and embedded real-time systems. I am especially interested in developing theory, architectural support, and computing abstractions for predictability in software systems, motivated by the increasing software complexity and the growing sources of non-determinism. Applications range from sensor networks to large-scale server farms, and from transportation systems to medicine. New in Navigation: Green GPS . Brief Biosketch .

 Sarita Adve University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Teaching Research Publications Students Contact Info for Students Fun Stuff Sarita V. Adve Richard T. Cheng Professor Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign sadve@illinois.edu Sarita V. Adve is the Richard T. Cheng Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . Her primary research interest is at the hardware-software interface with work spanning computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and applications. Her current research is on scalable system specialization and approximate computing. Sheco-developed the memory consistency models for the C++ and Java programming languages, which are based on her early work on data-race-free (DRF) models.More recently, her work questioned the conventional wisdom for memory models for heterogeneous systems and showed that DRF is a superior model even for such systems. She is also known for her contributions to cache coherence (she co-developed the simple and efficient DeNovo coherence protocol); hardware reliability (she co-developed software-driven approaches for hardware reliability in the SWAT project and the concept of lifetime reliability aware architectures and dynamic reliability management in the RAMP project); power management (she led the design of GRACE, one of the first systems to implement cross-layer energy management); exploiting instruction-level parallelism (ILP) for memory system performance (she co-authored some of the first papers on exploiting ILP for memory level parallelism); and evaluation techniques for shared-memory multiprocessors with ILP processors (she led the development of the RSIM architecture simulator). Professor Adve received the ACM/IEEE-CS Ken Kennedy award in 2018, was named a Woman of Vision in innovation by the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology in 2012, an IEEE fellow in 2012, an ACM fellow in 2010, received the ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes award in 2008, an IBM faculty award in 2005, was named a UIUC University Scholar in 2004, received an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 1998, an IBM University Partnership award in 1997 and 1998, and a National Science Foundation CAREER award in 1995. For three of the last five years (2014-18), Illinois CS has selected her students'PhD theses as one of the department's two nominations for the ACM doctoral dissertation award. She currently serves as the chair of ACM SIGARCH , on the DARPA/ISAT study group, and on ACM Council. She previously served on the board of directors of the Computing Research Association (CRA) (2009-18), on the National Science Foundation's CISE directorate's advisory committee (2003-05), on the expert group to revise the Java memory model (2001-05), and co-led the Intel/Microsoft funded Universal Parallel Computing Research Center (UPCRC) at Illinois as its director of research in its founding year (2008-09). Professor Adve was the first woman of South Asian origin to be named fellow of the ACMand, as a Maurice Wilkes awardee, the first woman to receive a young-, mid-, or life-career award in computer architecture research. She is deeply committed to increasing the number of women in computing by influencing change that can enable more women to be successful at all stages of thecareer pipeline. She received the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 1993 and 1989 respectively, and the B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay in 1987. Before joining Illinois, she was on the faculty at Rice University from 1993 to 1999.

Gillies Professor|Computer Science Department|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Research Projects Prof. Vikram Adve F ollow the individual project links for more details about each project and relevant publications: ALLVM: Exploring the benefits for software performance, security and reliability if all software on a system (either all userspace software or or userspace+OS software) is available in a rich virtual instruction set that can be analyzed and transformed by sophisticated compiler techniques (think Java bytecode, but for all software). Heterogeneous Parallel Virtual Machine : A compiler infrastructure and parallel program representationfor heterogeneous parallel systems, with the goal of making it much easier to write performance-portable parallel programs. A single program in the HPVM representation can be compiled to GPUsand tomulticore CPUs (with and without) vector extensions, while achieving performance close to separately hand-tuned code for each of those systems. The project is alsoexploring code generation for FPGAs, for specializeddeep-in-memory compute hardware, and developing optimizingcompilersforparallel languages like OpenMP and Domain Specific Languages. Automated Debugging for Software Failures : We are developing automated static and dynamic analysis techniques tounderstand the causes of failures in software systems, in order tohelp programmers diagnose and fix software bugs with as little effort as possible. The project is investigating automated fault localization and diagnosis techniques for both standalone and distributed programs. The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure : A novel virtual instruction set and compiler infrastructure that enables lifelong analysis and transformation of programs in arbitrary programming languages. LLVM is a key foundation for some of our other ongoing projects, including ALLVM and HPVM. Previous Projects Deterministic-by-default Parallel Programming : Language and compiler techniques to make parallel programming far easier than it is today, by enabling programmers to write provably deterministic parallel programs, and by enforcing that any non-deterministic behavior is made explicit and isolated. SVA: Secure Virtual Architecture : A compiler-based virtual machine for commodity operating systems that can greatly enhance the security and reliability of todays systems. SAFECode: Compiler techniques to enforce memory safety and other safety properties efficiently for unmodified C programs.

I am always looking for outstanding graduate or undergraduate students for the projects listed above. More than anything else, I am looking for students who are (a) creative andintellectually strong, and (b) ambitious and hard-working. I take on undergraduates, Masters (MS) students and Ph.D. students. I can generally give Research Assistantships only to Ph.D. students because our research funding is nearly always intended for long term research projects that require a sustained effort over several years. Note that if you join our group as a Ph.D. student, you should not expect to stop after 1.5 or 2 years with an MS degree: the research projects will generally not be appropriate for an MS thesis, which is relatively narrow research. I am willing to take on students interested in an MS for shorter term projects. An MS thesis nearly always must be publishable research, though in exceptional circumstances, I think an MS might be justified for development or experimental work that contributes significantly to one or more of our projects. I am always looking for outstanding undergraduate students interested in research and/or programming experience. I have taken on students ranging from seniors to freshmen: what I look for is someone with an interest in experimental software research, and the drive to work hard and succeed. If you fit these criteria, send me email with a subject line that has the prefix: [Prospective Student] Or, use this link to send me email just so I know you have read this (I am not filtering such email!). Include an up-to-date CV or resum, and say what degree you seek and what project(s) in our group interest you. I will contact you if I want to follow up . I get a lot of such email, so do not take it personally if I do not reply. Thanks for your interest! Log In

The main goal of this research is to develop a SoC real-time computing architecture that integrates hardware and software execution in a transparent manner, and can support QoS adaptation by means of partial reconfiguration of modern FPGA devices. CSR: Memory-Centric Real-Time Scheduling for Multicore Embedded Systems . M. Caccamo (PI), Co-PI: L. Sha , National Science Foundation, CNS-1219064 In modern automotive and avionics applications, the use of multiple sensors and especially real-time imaging sensors creates unprecedented workloads. From a computational perspective, multicore architectures have become mainstream; however, as a multicore chip is expected to process increasing volumes of data in real-time, the memory hierarchy becomes the bottleneck resource. In the worst case, task execution times can grow linearly with the number of cores in the system. This research aims at laying foundations for a modern memory-centric real-time scheduling theory that can effectively co-schedule the use of the memory hierarchy, the cores, and the on-chip network, including the I/O channels. According to the vision of Memory-Centric Scheduling, when the memory hierarchy is the system bottleneck, memory accesses should be scheduled to achieve high memory utilization. Performance of a real-time multicore system should be measured in terms of schedulable memory utilization rather than just core utilization. Ideally, the real-time constraints should be met as long as total memory utilization of all real-time applications (across all the cores contending for shared memory) is below 100%. See the presentation titled " The Migration of Safety-Critical RT Software to Multicore " ( pptx ) for learning about major findings of this research. CSR: Multicore Real Time Virtual Partitions . L. Sha (PI), Co-PIs: M. Caccamo, T. Abdelzaher, National Science Foundation, CNS-1302563 Embedded industry has a large body of certified real time safety and mission critical software developed for single core chips, using certification procedures developed for single core systems. Now, those chips are becoming obsolete, and newer chips are being designed with slower clock rates but multiple cores. Multicore computer platforms pose new challenges for hard real-time systems, because of the complex temporal coupling between processing cores' shared last level cache, shared memory and I/O bandwidth. This research aims at tackling this industry-wide challenge by introducing the notion of real time virtual partitions (RTVPs), each of which can be treated as a stand-alone single-core chip from the point of view of real-time schedulability analysis and certification process. Without a technology like RTVP, the change of workload in one core could adversely impact the schedulability of tasks in other cores, triggering the recertification of applications running on other cores. The time and costs of such recertification is economically unsustainable. This problem is especially critical for the avionic industry. Single Core Equivalence (SCE): a cost-effective solution for the transition of safety-critical RT software from single-core to multi-core commodity platforms. CPS: Breakthrough: Solar-powered, Long-endurance UAV for Real-time Onboard Data Processing . M. Caccamo (PI), National Science Foundation, CNS-1646383 Given the wide range of possibilities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent a growing market in CPS and they are perceived as an "enabling technology" to re-consider the human involvement in many military and civil applications on a global scale. One of the major challenges in enabling this growth is UAV endurance. This is directly related to the amount of energy available to the UAV to perform its mission. This proposal looks to increase UAV endurance by trading off UAV performance with energy efficient computing. This requires mapping of mission and goals into energy needs and computational requirements. The goal of the project is to show that this trade can enable long-duration flight especially when solar energy is utilized as a primary energy source. The ambitious plan is to develop a light weight and efficient aircraft capable of maneuver-aware power adaptation and real-time video/sensor acquisition and processing for up to 12 hours of continuous flight (this limit being set by daylight hours). This project aims to expanding the theoretical and practical foundations for the design and integration of UAVs capable of real-time sensing and processing from an array of visual, acoustic and other sensors.

PI: Kevin C.C. Chang . News . Research. I lead the FORWARD Group , which is part of the larger Data and Information Systems Laboratories , at the CS department of UIUC. Our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured big data --- to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world's information. Therefore, o ur research spans across data mining, data management/databases , information retrieval, machine learning , with current efforts focusing on interactive data management , entity-centric Web search and mining , social media analytics, and social network mining . As our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real world applications. As our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data.

I teach mostly large algorithms classes ; you might find my lecture notes useful. From 2013 to 2016, Iwas an associate department head and chair of the faculty recruiting committee. Ihave the lowest undergraduate GPA (2.4/4.0) of any professor I've ever met, although some of my colleagues came close, and some others never finished college at all.

Because of my kids, I'm on an early schedule: typically at Siebel by 8:30, often out of the office late afternoon. Try email or piazza when you can't find me in person. Orange times towards the end of the day mostly involve transporting children, so I may be able to free these times (e.g. get my husband to take them) with advance notice. WARNING: not all meetings are set up yet. In particular, I'll have a couple office hours (beyond the implied one at the end of lecture), but I still have to figure out which times they'll be.

I have concentrated in two areas: the development of scalable numerical algorithms for partial differential equations (PDEs), especially for the linear systems that arise from approximations to PDEs, and the development of programming models and systems for expressing and implementing highly scalable applications. In each of these areas, I have led the development of software that has been widely adopted. PETSc is a powerful numerical library for the solution of linear and nonlinear systems of equations. MPI is the mostly widely used parallel programming system for large scale scientific computing. The MPICH implementation of MPI is one of the most widely used and is the implementation of choice for the world's fastest machines. A new interest is the development of a Deep Learning Major Research Instrument Project , which combines my interests in HPC software and numerics and high-performance I/O with the revolution in machine learning. Research Opportunities I have an active research program and currently have openings for graduate students, post docs, and scientific programmers.

Ensuring Tight Computational Security Against Higher-Order DPA Attacks PST 2011 Dakshita Khurana and Aditya Gaurav Research Overview: Within cryptography, my work designs secure protocols resisting active attacks while requiring minimal interaction. Some of my work [ KS17 , GKS16 ] has constructed protocols achieving security against man-in-the-middle attacks with minimal back-and-forth interaction, disproving and overcoming perceived impossibilities in the area. My work has also constructed non-interactive proof systems for NP achieving some desirable properties. Specifically, in [ JKKR17 ], we rely on well-studied assumptions to construct such proof systems achieving variants of zero-knowledge. These recently helped build other secure protocols with optimal interaction [ K17 , BGJKKS17 ]. In very recent work [ BKKSW17 ], we build succinct non-interactive proof systems for verifiably outsourcing non-deterministic computation with verification time growing only with the non-deterministic space complexity of computation, based for the first time on standard cryptographic assumptions. I have also worked on unconditionally secure computation using untrusted or leaky hardware, on differential privacy, and on program obfuscation. 
 Alex Kirlik Professor 4220 Siebel Center for Comp Sci 201 N. Goodwin Ave. Urbana Illinois 61801 (217) 244-8972 kirlik@illinois.edu : Primary Research Area Graphics, Visualization and HCI - Human-Computer Interaction Research Areas Human-Computer Interaction Visualization Biography Alex Kirlik is Professor in the Department of Computer Science with additional appointments in the Department of Industrial & Enterprise Systems Engineering, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, and the Information Trust Institute, the Coordinated Science Laboratory, the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory and the Illinois Informatics Institute. He previously served as acting head of Illinois's Human Factors program in the Institute of Aviation from 2006-2010. Alex earned his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Industrial & Systems Engineering (Human-Machine Systems) at The Ohio State University. His Ph.D. thesis, "The organization of perception and action in complex control skills" earned the George Briggs Award from APA's Division of Applied Experimental and Engineering Psychologists, as the best dissertation of the year. During his academic career, in addition to positions held with his home institutions at the University of Illinois (2002-date) and Georgia Tech (1989-2001), Alex has held visiting positions at Stanford University and NASA Ames Research Center (ASEE-NASA Stanford Summer Faculty Fellow, 1989, 1990), Yale University, Haskins Laboratory and the University of Connecticut (Visiting Scholar, 2001-02 academic year), Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, MA (Sabbatical Research, 2012-13 academic year), and the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety (Visiting Scholar, summer 2015). Alex's research interests include human-computer interaction, human factors, visual analytics to support judgment and decision making, human-robot interaction, social computing, human-automation interaction and decision support is sociotechnical systems such as aviation, space, intelligence analysis, severe weather forecasting, disaster and emergency response, healthcare and medicine, autonomous vehicles, education and so forth. Alex's approach to teaching and mentoring students is naturally dependent of the level of instruction involved. Perhaps one notable aspect of his educational approach is that no crisp line can be drawn between his interests and activities in research and teaching. For example, he has advised 2 PhD dissertations on the development and evaluation of new techniques and technologies for teaching engineering design.His research and educational activities also dovetail in the realm of his graduate seminars, which are intensively group- and project-based, typically involving students in actual research projects to motivate and animate the course material. For example, in 2010 Alex seized on an opportunity afforded by a U.S. Challenge.gov Health and Human Services competition that required competing project teams to design a Facebook app that would be useful to people in the aftermath of natural disasters and emergencies. This project not only involved the students, working as a design team, to create a conceptual design for the app, but to also create a working software prototype and a video demo. The competition was open to any group who wanted to enter it was not specifically targeted to the educational community or to educational institutions. The students design earned 3rd place nationally. Education Ph.D. Industrial & Systems Engineering, The Ohio State University, 1989. . Research Statement Alex Kirliks research program in human-computer interaction, human factors, and cognitive science & engineering has focused on understanding and supporting the cognition (judgment, decision making, prediction, problem solving and system control), of professionals working in technological workplaces, operational contexts and sociotechnical systems. His research contributing to commercial aviation safety in both airborne and ground operations has been supported by NASA for over 25 years. Recently, aspects of these lines of research have matured into NSF- and NASA-sponsored multidisciplinary projects, joint with collaborators in aerospace, mechanical and software engineering, to create and evaluate formal techniques and general principles for the design of safe and robust cyber-physical-human systems comprised of people and hardware and software automation: Engineering Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) Systems. The aim of this research, which is relevant to applications not solely in aviation but in contexts such as healthcare and highways, is to achieve levels of human-automation system performance, robustness and safety exceeding what would be achievable by either a human or automation acting alone. A 5-minute public video demo illustrating this work in an aviation context is available at: www.youtube.com/watch . A second major thrust of Alex's research concerns support for judgment and decision making in high-stakes tasks. This line of research developed into an NSF-sponsored project to develop and evaluate quantitative models of judgment in technological systems (e.g., KIrlik, 2006, Adaptive Perspectives on Human-Technology Interaction , NY: Oxford; see: www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780195171822/ ). Recently, Alex also participated in an IARPA-sponsored project to develop visual analytics to support intelligence analysts in forecasting world events: http://www.draper.com/news/draper-team-aims-improve-predictions-through-sp-de/?cc=us&lang=en&" , and most recently, he and his multi-disciplinary team began a 3-year research project involving the design and use of domestic, aerial and ground robotics to support aging-in-place called ASPIRE: Automation Supporting Prolonged Independent Residence for the Elderly, sponsored by the National Robotics Initiative. A brief video showing progress to date, presented at the October, 2016 "Aging 2.0" conference in San Francisco can be viewed at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoUvRaTnA8c#action=share" Also, Alex has co-edited (with J.D. Lee) the first authoritative handbook of its kind, The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Engineering (2013), representing the contributions of more than 60 of the disciplines most influential and accomplished researchers. He has been editor of the Oxford Series in Human-Technology Interaction for Oxford University Press for more than 10 years, a series that includes more than a dozen scholarly books and edited volumes by prominent researchers published to date: https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/h/human-technology-interaction-series-hti/?cc=us&lang=en& Undergraduate Research Opportunities Alex often has paid or for-credit undergraduate research opportunities in both human-computer interaction and human factors.

 Ranjitha Kumar RANJITHA@ILLINOIS.EDU Curriculum Vitae SIEBEL 4224 FALL 2017 OH: WED 1-2PM I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and (by courtesy) the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . I run the Data Driven Design Group , where my students and I leverage data mining and machine learning to address the central challenge of creating good user experiences: tying design decisions to desired outcomes. I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University , where I worked with Scott Klemmer . I was formerly the Chief Scientist at Apropose, Inc., a data-driven design company I co-founded, which was backed by Andreessen Horowitz and New Enterprise Associates . SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Learning Design Semantics for Mobile Apps Thomas F. Liu, Mark Craft, Jason Situ, Ersin Yumer, Radomir Mech, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '18 Recently, researchers have developed black-box approaches to mine design and interaction data from mobile apps. Although the data captured during this interaction mining is descriptive, it does not expose the design semantics of UIs: what elements on the screen mean and how they are used. This paper introduces an automatic approach for generating semantic annotations for mobile app UIs. Through an iterative open coding of 73k UI elements and 720 screens, we contribute a lexical database of 25 types of UI components, 197 text button concepts, and 135 icon classes shared across apps. We use this labeled data to learn code-based patterns to detect UI components and to train a convolutional neural network that distinguishes between icon classes with 94% accuracy. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach at scale, we compute semantic annotations for the 72k unique UIs in the Rico dataset, assigning labels for 78% of the total visible, non-redundant elements. Learning Type-Aware Embeddings for Fashion Compatibility Mariya I. Vasileva, Bryan A. Plummer, Krishna Dusad, Shreya Rajpal, Ranjitha Kumar, and David Forsyth Proceedings of ECCV '18 Outfits in online fashion data are composed of items of many different types (e.g. top, bottom, shoes) that share some stylistic relationship with one another. A representation for building outfits requires a method that can learn both notions of similarity (for example, when two tops are interchangeable) and compatibility (items of possibly different type that can go together in an outfit). This paper presents an approach to learning an image embedding that respects item type, and jointly learns notions of item similarity and compatibility in an end-to-end model. To evaluate the learned representation, we crawled 68,306 outfits created by users on the Polyvore website. Our approach obtains 3-5% improvement over the state-of-the-art on outfit compatibility prediction and fill-in-the-blank tasks using our dataset, as well as an established smaller dataset, while supporting a variety of useful queries. Designing the Future of Personal Fashion Kristen Vaccaro, Tanvi Agarwalla, Sunaya Shivakumar, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of CHI '18 Advances in computer vision and machine learning are changing the way people dress, and buy clothes. Given the vast space of fashion problems, where can data-driven technologies provide the most value? To understand consumer pain points and opportunities for technological interventions, this paper presents the results from two independent need-finding studies that explore the gold-standard of personalized shopping: interacting with a personal stylist. Through interviews with five personal stylists, we study the range of problems they address and their in-person processes for working with clients. In a separate study, we investigate how styling experiences map to online settings by building and releasing a chatbot that connects users to one-on-one sessions with a stylist, acquiring more than 70 organic users in three weeks. These conversations reveal that in-person and online styling sessions share similar goals, but online sessions often involve smaller problems that can be resolved more quickly. Based on these explorations, we propose future personalized, online interactions that address consumer trust and uncertainty, and discuss opportunities for automation. ZIPT: Zero-Integration Performance Testing of Mobile App Designs Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, Chad Franzen, Jeffrey Nichols, Yang Li, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '17 To evaluate the performance of mobile app designs, designers and researchers employ techniques such as A/B, usability, and analytics-driven testing. While these are all useful strategies for evaluating known designs, comparing many divergent solutions to identify the most performant remains a costly and difficult problem. This paper introduces a design performance testing approach that leverages existing app implementations and crowd workers to enable comparative testing at scale. This approach is manifest in ZIPT, a zero-integration performance testing platform that allows designers to collect detailed design and interaction data over any Android app including apps they do not own and did not build. Designers can deploy scripted tests via ZIPT to collect aggregate user performance metrics (e.g., completion rate, time on task) and qualitative feedback over third-party apps. Through case studies, we demonstrate that designers can use ZIPTs aggregate data and visualizations to understand the relative performance of interaction patterns found in the wild, and identify usability issues in existing Android apps. Rico: A Mobile App Dataset for Building Data-Driven Design Applications Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, Chad Franzen, Joshua Hibschman, Daniel Afergan, Yang Li, Jeffrey Nichols, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '17 Data-driven models help mobile app designers understand best practices and trends, and can be used to make predictions about design performance and support the creation of adaptive UIs. This paper presents Rico, the largest repository of mobile app designs to date, created to support five classes of data-driven applications: design search, UI layout generation, UI code generation, user interaction modeling, and user perception prediction. To create Rico, we built a system that combines crowdsourcing and automation to scalably mine design and interaction data from Android apps at runtime. The Rico dataset contains design data from more than 9.7k Android apps spanning 27 categories. It exposes visual, textual, structural, and interactive design properties of more than 72k unique UI screens. To demonstrate the kinds of applications that Rico enables, we present results from training an autoencoder for UI layout similarity, which supports query-by-example search over UIs. Identifying Fashion Accounts in Social Networks Doris Jung-Lin Lee, Jinda Han, Dana Chambourova, and Ranjitha Kumar KDD Workshop on ML Meets Fashion '17 Fashion and style are characterized by the ebb and flow of trends. With the rise of social media, fashion blogs, and the fast-fashion movement, bottom-up fashion trends are emerging at an ever-increasing rate. Recognizing these trends as they happen --- and the influencers that create them --- is challenging for retailers and consumers alike. As a first step, this paper presents a classifier for identifying fashion-related accounts on social media. To develop this classifier, we created a dataset of 10k Twitter accounts from crawling the set of users followed by ten prominent fashion accounts, and crowdsourced ground-truth labels for them. Based on this training data and a set of content-based features, we trained a classifier that identfies whether or not a Twitter account is fashion-related. In the future, we hope to leverage this classifier to identify key fashion influencers and conduct large-scale monitoring of fashion trends. An Experimentation Engine for Data-Driven Fashion Systems Ranjitha Kumar and Kristen Vaccaro Proceedings of AAAI Symposium on UX of ML '17 Data-driven fashion systems of the future will revolutionize the way consumers shop for clothing and choose outfits: imagine an automated personal stylist that ships clothes straight to your door based on their compatibility with your existing wardrobe, the upcoming events on your calendar, and style trends learned from the web. To build such systems, we must identify the fashion activities that are the largest consumer pain points, the interventions necessary to alleviate those pains, and the computational models that enable those interventions. To guide the design of these next-generation tools, we propose an experimentation engine for fashion interfaces: leveraging social media platforms to run multivariate design tests with thousands to millions of users. Social platforms are already home to dedicated communities of fashion enthusiasts, and expose programmable agents --- chatbots --- that can be used to rapidly prototype data-driven design interfaces. Measuring the number of followers and user engagement amongst these prototypes can inform the design of future standalone fashion systems. At this workshop, we will sketch the design space of fashion experiments, and present preliminary results from deploying our fashion bots. ERICA: Interaction Mining For Mobile Apps Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '16 Design plays an important role in adoption of apps. App design, however, is a complex process with multiple design activities. To enable data-driven app design applications, we present interaction mining --- capturing both static (UI layouts, visual details) and dynamic (user flows, motion details) components of an app's design. We present ERICA, a system that takes a scalable, human-computer approach to interaction mining existing Android apps without the need to modify them in any way. As users interact with apps through ERICA, it detects UI changes, seamlessly records multiple data-streams in the background, and unifies them into a user interaction trace. Using ERICA we collected interaction traces from over a thousand popular Android apps. Leveraging this trace data, we built machine learning classifiers to detect elements and layouts indicative of 23 common user flows. User flows are an important component of UX design and consists of a sequence of UI states that represent semantically meaningful tasks such as searching or composing. With these classifiers, we identified and indexed more than 3000 flow examples, and released the largest online search engine of user flows in Android apps. The Elements of Fashion Style Kristen Vaccaro, Sunaya Shivakumar, Ziqiao Ding, Karrie Karahalios, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of UIST '16 The outfits people wear contain latent fashion concepts capturing styles, seasons, events, and environments. Fashion theorists have proposed that these concepts are shaped by design elements such as color, material, and silhouette. A dress may be bohemian because of its pattern, material, trim, or some combination of them: it is not always clear how low-level elements translate to high-level styles. In this paper, we use polylingual topic modeling to learn latent fashion concepts jointly in two languages capturing these elements and styles. Using this latent topic formation we can translate between these two languages through topic space, exposing the elements of fashion style. We train the polylingual topic model (PLTM) on a set of more than half a million outfits collected from Polyvore, a popular fashion-based social network. We present novel, data-driven fashion applications that allow users to express their needs in natural language just as they would to a real stylist and produce tailored item recommendations for these style needs. Learning Interpretable Musical Compositional Rules and Traces Haizi Yu, Lav R. Varshney, Guy E. Garnett, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of ICML WHI '16 Throughout music history, theorists have identified and documented interpretable rules that capture the decisions of composers. This paper asks, Can a machine behave like a music theorist? It presents MUS-ROVER, a self-learning system for automatically discovering rules from symbolic music. MUS-ROVER performs feature learning via n-gram models to extract compositional rules --- statistical patterns over the resulting features. We evaluate MUS-ROVER on Bachs (SATB) chorales, demonstrating that it can recover known rules, as well as identify new, characteristic patterns for further study. We discuss how the extracted rules can be used in both machine and human composition. Accounting for Taste: Ranking Curators and Content in Social Networks Haizi Yu, Biplab Deka, Jerry O. Talton, and Ranjitha Kumar Proceedings of CHI '16 Ranking users in social networks is a well-studied problem, typically solved by algorithms that leverage network structure to identify influential users and recommend people to follow. In the last decade, however, curation --- users sharing and promoting content in a network --- has become a central social activity, as platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and GitHub drive growth and engagement by connecting users through content and content to users. While existing algorithms reward users that are highly active with higher rankings, they fail to account for users' curatorial taste. This paper introduces CuRank, an algorithm for ranking users and content in social networks by explicitly modeling three characteristics of a good curator: discerning taste, high activity, and timeliness. We evaluate CuRank on datasets from two popular social networks --- GitHub and Vine --- and demonstrate its efficacy at ranking content and identifying good curators. What Makes a Brand Look Expensive? Jingxian Zhang, Neel Kothari, Asad Butt, and Ranjitha Kumar Extended Abstracts of CHI '16 Branding is a powerful tool that companies use to control the perception of their products' quality and price. A company's website is a digital vehicle for conveying this brand information. The look and feel of a website often influence a customer's impression of a brand's price category. To understand what makes a brand look expensive, we evaluate the website designs of two industries --- watches and cars. We ran a crowdsourced study to collect ratings of perceived cost based on web page screenshots. By training a random forest regression model over these ratings, we learned which visual features of website design are predictive of perceived cost. Webzeitgeist: Design Mining the Web Ranjitha Kumar, Arvind Satyanarayan, Cesar Torres, Maxine Lim, Salman Ahmad, Scott R. Klemmer, and Jerry O. Talton Proceedings of CHI '13 BEST PAPER AWARD Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery have transformed the way Web sites are designed. However, while visual presentation is an intrinsic part of the Web, traditional data mining techniques ignore render-time page structures and their attributes. This paper introduces design mining for the Web: using knowledge discovery techniques to understand design demographics, automate design curation, and support data-driven design tools. This idea is manifest in Webzeitgeist, a platform for large-scale design mining comprising a repository of over 100,000 Web pages and 100 million design elements. This paper describes the principles driving design mining, the implementation of the Webzeitgeist architecture, and the new class of data-driven design applications it enables. Learning Structural Semantics for the Web Maxine Lim, Ranjitha Kumar, Arvind Satyanarayan, Cesar Torres, Jerry O. Talton, and Scott R. Klemmer Stanford University CSTR 2012-03 Researchers have long envisioned a Semantic Web, where unstructured Web content is replaced by documents with rich semantic annotations. Unfortunately, this vision has been hampered by the difficulty of acquiring semantic metadata for Web pages. This paper introduces a method for automatically 'semantifying' structural page elements: using machine learning to train classifiers that can be applied in a post-hoc fashion. We focus on one popular class of semantic identifiers: those concerned with the structureor information architectureof a page. To determine the set of structural semantics to learn and to collect training data for the learning, we gather a large corpus of labeled page elements from a set of online workers. We discuss the results from this collection and demonstrate that our classifiers learn structural semantics in a general way. Learning Design Patterns with Bayesian Grammar Induction Jerry O. Talton, Lingfeng Yang, Ranjitha Kumar, Maxine Lim, Noah D. Goodman, and Radomr Mch Proceedings of UIST '12 BEST PAPER NOMINEE Design patterns have proven useful in many creative fields, providing content creators with archetypal, reusable guidelines to leverage in projects. Creating such patterns, however, is a time-consuming, manual process, typically relegated to a few experts in any given domain. In this paper, we describe an algorithmic method for learning design patterns directly from data using techniques from natural language processing and structured concept learning. Given a set of labeled, hierarchical designs as input, we induce a probabilistic formal grammar over these exemplars. Once learned, this grammar encodes a set of generative rules for the class of designs, which can be sampled to synthesize novel artifacts. We demonstrate the method on geometric models and Web pages, and discuss how the learned patterns can drive new interaction mechanisms for content creators. Data-Driven Web Design Ranjitha Kumar, Jerry O. Talton, Salman Ahmad, and Scott R. Klemmer Proceedings of ICML '12 INVITED APPLICATIONS PAPER This short paper summarizes challenges and opportunities of applying machine learning methods to Web design problems, and describes how structured prediction, deep learning, and probabilistic program induction can enable useful interactions for designers. We intend for these techniques to foster new work in data-driven Web design. Flexible Tree Matching Ranjitha Kumar, Jerry O. Talton, Salman Ahmad, Tim Roughgarden, and Scott R. Klemmer Proceedings of IJCAI '11 INVITED PAPER Tree-matching problems arise in many computational domains. The literature provides several methods for creating correspondences between labeled trees; however, by definition, tree-matching algorithms rigidly preserve ancestry. That is, once two nodes have been placed in correspondence, their descendants must be matched as well. We introduce flexible tree matching, which relaxes this rigid requirement in favor of a tunable formulation in which the role of hierarchy can be controlled. We show that flexible tree matching is strongly NP-complete, give a stochastic approximation algorithm for the problem, and demonstrate how structured prediction techniques can learn the algorithm's parameters from a set of example matchings. Finally, we present results from applying the method to tasks in Web design. Bricolage: Example-Based Retargeting for Web Design Ranjitha Kumar, Jerry O. Talton, Salman Ahmad, and Scott R. Klemmer Proceedings of CHI '11 BEST PAPER AWARD The Web provides a corpus of design examples unparalleled in human history. However, leveraging existing designs to produce new pages is often difficult. This paper introduces the Bricolage algorithm for transferring design and content between Web pages. Bricolage employs a novel, structured-prediction technique that learns to create coherent mappings between pages by training on human-generated exemplars. The produced mappings are then used to automatically transfer the content from one page into the style and layout of another. We show that Bricolage can learn to accurately reproduce human page mappings, and that it provides a general, efficient, and automatic technique for retargeting content between a variety of real Web pages. Designing with Interactive Example Galleries Brian Lee, Savil Srivastava, Ranjitha Kumar, Ronen Brafman, and Scott R Klemmer Proceedings of CHI '10 Designers often use examples for inspiration; examples offer contextualized instances of how form and content integrate. Can interactive example galleries bring this practice to everyday users doing design work, and does working with examples help the designs they create? This paper explores whether people can realize significant value from explicit mechanisms for designing by example modification. We present the results of three studies, finding that independent raters prefer designs created with the aid of examples, that users prefer adaptively selected examples to random ones, and that users make use of multiple examples when creating new designs. To enable these studies and demonstrate how software tools can facilitate designing with examples, we introduce interface techniques for browsing and borrowing from a corpus of examples, manifest in the Adaptive Ideas Web design tool. Adaptive Ideas leverages a faceted metadata interface for viewing and navigating example galleries.

 I am interested in machine learning, security, privacy, game theory, blockchain and related topics. I havedesigned several robust learning algorithms, a scalable framework for achieving robustness for a range of learning methods, and a privacy preserving data publishing system. I amcurrently working on anomaly detection systems against causative poisoning attacks and malware detection with real world collected big data. I'm also working on adversarial deep learning for training generative adversarial networks (GAN) and designing robust deep neural networks against adversarial examples. Theoretically, Iutilize game theoretic analyses to model the interactions between an intelligent adversary and a machine learner, allowing defender to design robust learning strategies that explicitly account for an adversarys optimal response. Empirically, my currentresearchaims to scalable robust algorithms that can process massive amounts of data available for Internet-scale problems regarding specific cloud computing infrastructure to achieve large-scale secure learning for big data. Previously I have worked onInformation security, Network security, MRI analysis, and other Healthcare related research, andI'm still interested in these topics.

Note: In Computer Science, publications at top-ranking conferences are considered more important and prestigious than journals (of course they have their place as well). Here is an official memo from the Computing Research Association (CRA) stating that fact. Some systems/real-time conference rankings: 1 , 2 , 3 . Of course, these not authoritative and not in any order, and they seem to have a slight bias towards US-based conferences. . Behavior-Based Intrusion Detection Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have distinct cyber and physical components that must work cohesivelywith each other to ensure correct operation. Examples include automobiles, power plants,avionics systems, home automation systems, etc. Traditionally such systems were isolated from externalaccesses and used proprietary components and protocols. Hence, they were considered tobe invulnerable to cyber attacks. The recent Stuxnet worm and other similar attacks have shownthat even such systems are not immune to compromise. A failure to protect these systems fromharm could result in significant harm to humans, the environment or even critical infrastructure. On the other hand, many cyber-physical systems have real-time constraints i.e., they must functioncorrectly within predetermined time scales. Systems that have such real-time properties are predictable by design . Designers work really hard to ensure that the execution behavior of such systems(e.g., execution time, memory usage, control flow, system properties, etc.) are analyzed andcontrolled to a high level of detail so as to guarantee predictable behavior. This project aims to use this very predictability of real-time CPS to detect intrusions as soon asthey occur and take evasive actions . This will be then combined with the development of an architecturalframework to: detect intrusions and guarantee that the underlying physical systemdoes not come to harm . The development of analysis techniques and intrusion-detection architectures will inherently make such systems more secure and hence, safer. It will bring us one stepcloser to understanding how to integrate two seemingly diverse yet important fields, CPS andsecurity, while gaining a better understanding of both areas. The ideas that will be developed as part of this project have the potential for significant impact ona diverse set of domains. Apart from the research community, government agencies and industrycould also gain significantly from results produced as part of this research. It will make manycritical aspects of modern day life such as aircraft, vehicles, critical infrastructures (power grid,water treatment plants, etc.) much safer.

Integrating Security in Real-Time Embedded Systems Embedded real-time systems (RTS) are used to monitor and control physical systems and processes in varied domains. Formerly, most such systems remained isolated from the rest of the world, and applications were partitioned in isolated processing nodes that offered protection from cyber-attacks. Increasingly, these systems are now being connected together, and there does not exist a comprehensive framework for integrating security into embedded RTS; retrofitting existing systems is usually ineffective. Traditionally, real-time systems are modeled as sets of periodic tasks that are then scheduled on a collection of resources. Any security-related mechanisms must work within the imposed restrictions of real-time systems; on the other hand, those properties of RTS make it easier to model systems and perform rigorous analysis of developed solutions. This project is aimed at developing (1) an understanding of threat landscapes; (2) security mechanisms that are unique to this domain; and (3) theories, policies, models, algorithms, and mechanisms that bring the domains of security and real-time systems together. The work is answering questions such as: when solutions are developed that integrate security with real-time systems theory, can we classify solutions based on how effectively they meet real-time requirements as well as improve system security? Can this be used to aid in development of robust systems that can monitor themselves and detect events?

In initial work, we have been able to cast certain security properties (viz. information leakage) as constraints for fixed-priority real-time schedulers. Using traditional schedulability and response-time analysis we have been able to show the effects of such methods. Designers of real-time systems can now decide on how much security (i.e. protection against information leakage) they can tolerate in comparison to the real-time requirements.

Real-Time Systems A real-time system is is defined as a system that has both : Logical, and Temporal correctness. The temporal correctness is defined in the form of a constraint, usually termed as deadline . The usefulness of results produced by the system drops significantly, at times, to zero, on the passing of this constraint. Real-time systems are broadly classified into the following categories : Hard : The usefulness of results on the passing of the contraint falls sharply and missing such constraints could lead to catastrophic effects to the system, then user, the environment, or all of them. Eg. : ABS system in cars, safety control of nuclear reactors, etc. Soft : The usefulness of results falls gradually, on the passing of the constraint, and a few missed deadlines can be tolerated by the system, without catastrophic results. Eg. : MPEG decoding of streaming video. A real-time system is defined as a collection of tasks , each of which is defined as : {phi, p, e, d} , where : phi : phase p : period e : worst-case execution time of the task - the guaranteed upper bound on execution time of the task, for all possible inputs. d : temporal constraint, deadline. Real-time systems theory reasons about the schedulability of task sets i.e. , offline schedulability tests, which can determine if all deadlines of a set of tasks can be met. Task parameters have to be known beforehand, i.e ., parameters such as period of each task, the worst-case execution time (WCET), and so on. Periods of tasks are determined from the operating environment, such as temporal constraints on sensors, actuators and other parts of the system. Determining the WCET for tasks is a non-trivial effort due to software complexity, non-determinism of inputs and hardware complexity with unpredictable execution behavior. . Publication: Rapid Early-Phase Virtual Integration Authors : Sibin Mohan , Min-Young Nam , Rodolfo Pellizzoni , Lui Sha , Richard Bradford and Shana Fliginger. Abstract : In complex hard real-time systems with tight constraints on system resources, small changes in one component of a system can cause a cascade of adverse effects on other parts of the system. We address the inherent complexity of making architectural decisions by raising the level of abstraction at which the analysis is performed. Our analysis approach gives the system architect a rigorous method for quickly determining which system architectures should be pursued, and it allows the architect to track and manage the cascading effects of subsystem/component changes in a comprehensive, quantitative manner. The end product is a virtual architecture analysis that systematically incorporates the inherent coupling among interacting system components that share limited system resources. Here is a link to the full paper and slides to the talk at RTSS. This was presented at the IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium ( RTSS ) , held in Washington DC in December 2009 . . Publication : CheckerCore: Enhancing an FPGA Soft Core to Capture Worst-Case Execution Times Authors : Jin Ouyang , Raghuveer Raghavendra, Sibin Mohan , Tao Zhang , Yuan Xie and Frank Mueller . Abstract : Embedded processors have become increasingly complex, resulting in variable execution behavior and reduced timing predictability. On such processors, safe timing specifications expressed as bounds on the worst-case execution time (WCET) are generally too loose due to conservative assumptions about complex architectural features, timing anomalies and programmatic complexities. Hence, exploiting the latest architectures may not be an option for embedded systems with hard real-time constraints where deadline misses cannot be tolerated. This work addresses these shortcomings by contributing CheckerCore. CheckerCore is a mode-enhanced SPARC v8 soft core processor synthesized on an FPGA. During regular execution the core adheres to its original specifications. But when operating in a special time-checking configuration, CheckerCore executes programs irrespective of inputs and steers execution along selected control flow paths. Such execution allows systematic derivation of worst-case execution time (WCET) bounds. This paper presents the design and implementation of CheckerCore and illustrates its use in deriving accurate WCET bounds for a set of embedded benchmarks. Overall, CheckerCore proposes a realistic processor core enhancement that encapsulate processor details without revealing them to users while supporting safe bounding of WCETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first contribution of a WCET-enhancing microarchitectural feature besides full processor encapsulations.

Publication : Push-Assisted Migration of Real-Time Tasks in Multi-Core Processors Authors : Abhik Sarkar, Frank Mueller , Harini Ramaprasad and Sibin Mohan . Abstract : Multicores are becoming ubiquitous, not only in general-purpose but also embedded computing. This trend is a reflection of contemporary embedded applications posing steadily increasing demands in processing power. On such platforms, prediction of timing behavior to ensure that deadlines of real-time tasks can be met is becoming increasingly difficult. While real-time multicore scheduling approaches help to assure deadlines based on firm theoretical properties, their reliance on task migration poses a significant challenge to timing predictability in practice. Task migration actually (a) reduces timing predictability for contemporary multicores due to cache warm-up overheads while (b) increasing traffic on the network-on-chip (NoC) interconnect. This paper puts forth a fundamentally new approach to increase the timing predictability of multicore architectures aimed at task migration in embedded environments. A task migration between two cores imposes cache warm-up overheads on the migration target, which can lead to missed deadlines for tight real-time schedules.We propose novel micro-architectural support to migrate cache lines. Our scheme shows dramatically increased predictability in the presence of cross-core migration. Experimental results for schedules demonstrate that our scheme enables real-time tasks to meet their deadlines in the presence of task migration. Our results illustrate that increases in execution time due to migration is reduced by our scheme to levels that may prevent deadline misses of real-time tasks that would otherwise occur. Our mechanism imposes an overhead at a fraction of the tasks execution time, yet this overhead can be steered to fill idle slots in the schedule, i.e., it does not contribute to the execution time of the migrated task. Overall, our novel migration scheme provides a unique mechanism capable of significantly increasing timing predictability in the wake of task migration.

Ph.D. Thesis : Exploiting Hardware/Software Interactions for Analyzing Embedded Systems Author : Sibin Mohan Abstract : Em bedded systems are often subject to real-time timing constraints. Such systems require determinism to ensure that task deadlines are met. The knowledge of the bounds on worst-case execution times (WCET) of tasks is a critical piece of information required to achieve this objective. One limiting factor in designing real-time systems is the class of processors that may be used. Contemporary processors with their advanced architectural features, such as out-of-order execution, branch prediction, speculation, and prefetching, cannot be statically analyzed to obtain WCETs for tasks as they introduce non-determinism into task execution, which can only be resolved at run-time. Such micro-processors are tuned to reduce average-case execution times at the expense of predictability. Hence, they do not find use in hard real-time systems. On the other hand, static timing analysis derives bounds on WCETs but requires that bounds on loop iterations be known statically, i.e., at compile time. This limits the class of applications that may be analyzed by static timing analysis and, hence, used in a real-time system. Finally, many embedded systems have communication and/or synchronization constructs and need to function on a wide spectrum of hardware devices ranging from small micro-controllers to modern multi-core architectures. Hence, any single analysis technique (be it static or dynamic) will not suffice in gauging the true nature of such systems. This thesis contributes novel techniques that use combinations of analysis methods and constant interactions between them to tackle complexities in modern embedded systems. To be more specific, this thesis (I) introduces of a new paradigm that proposes minor enhancements to modern processor architectures, which, on interaction with software modules, is able to obtain tight, accurate timing analysis results for modern processors; (II) it shows how the constraint concerning statically bound loops may be relaxed and applied to make dynamic decisions at run-time to achieve power savings; (III) it represents the temporal behavior of distributed real-time applications as colored graphs coupled with graph reductions/transformations that attempt to capture inherent meaning in the application. To the best of my knowledge, these methods that utilize interactions between different sources of information to analyze modern embedded systems are a first of their kind.

Publication : Merging State and Preserving Timing Anomalies in Pipelines of High-End Processors Authors : Sibin Mohan and Frank Mueller . Abstract : Many embedded systems are subject to temporal constraints that require advance guarantees on meeting deadlines. Such systems rely on static analysis to safely bound worst-case execution (WCET) bounds of tasks. Designers of these systems are forced to avoid state-of-the-art processors due to their inherent architectural complexity (such as out-of-order instruction scheduling) that results in non-determinism. This work addresses this problem by providing novel pipeline analysis techniques for characterizing the worst-case behavior of real-time systems on modern processor architectures. We introduce methods to capture (snapshot) pipeline state and to subsequently perform a merge of previously captured snapshots. We prove that our pipeline analysis correctly preserves worst-case timing behavior on OOO processor pipelines. We further specifically show that anomalous pipeline effects, effectively dilating timing, are preserved by our method. To the best of our knowledge, this method of pipeline analysis and interactions between hardware/software for obtaining WCET bounds on OOO processors is the first of its kind.

Publication : Hybrid Timing Analysis of Modern Processor Pipelines via Hardware/Software Interactions Authors : Sibin Mohan and Frank Mueller . Abstract : Embedded systems are often subject to constraints that require determinism to ensure that task deadlines are met. Such systems are referred to as real-time systems. Schedulability analysis provides a firm basis to ensure that tasks meet their deadlines for which knowledge of worst-case execution time (WCET) bounds is a critical piece of information. Static timing analysis techniques are used to derive these WCET bounds. A limiting factor for designing real-time systems is the class of processors that can be used. Typically, modern, complex processor pipelines cannot be used in real-time systems design. Contemporary processors with their advanced architectural features, such as out-of-order execution, branch prediction, speculation, prefetching, etc., cannot be statically analyzed to obtain tight WCET bounds for tasks. The main reason is that these features introduce non-determinism to task execution that surfaces in full only at runtime. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm to perform timing analysis of tasks for real-time systems running on modern processor architectures. We propose minor enhancements to the processor architecture to enable this process. These features, on interaction with software modules, are able to obtain tight, accurate timing analysis results for modern processors. We also briefly present analysis techniques that, combined with our timing analysis methods, reduce the complexity of worst-case estimations for loops. To the best of our knowledge, this method of constant interactions between hardware and software to calculate WCET bounds for out-of-order processors is the first of its kind.

Publication : Temporal Analysis for Adapting Concurrent Applications to Embedded Systems Authors : Sibin Mohan and Johannes Helander . Abstract : Embedded services and applications that interact with the real world often, over time, need to run on different kinds of hardware which range in capability from low-cost microcontrollers with very limited memory to powerful multicore processors. It is quite difficult to write one program that would work reliably on such a wide range of devices. This is especially true when the application must be temporally predictable and robust which should usually be the case since the physical world works in real-time. Thus, any application interacting with such a system, distributed or not, must also work in real-time. In this paper we introduce a representation of the temporal behavior of an application as a colored graph that captures the timing of temporally continuous sections of execution, called bars, and the dependencies between the bars, creating a partial order. We then introduce a method of extracting the graph from existing applications using a combination of static, dynamic and other analyses. Once the graph has been created we employ a number of graph transformations, introduced here, that extract ``meaning'' from the graph. The knowledge gained can be utilized for scheduling and by the programmer for adjusting the level of parallelism suitable to the specific hardware, for identifying hot spots, false parallelism, or even candidates for additional concurrency. Graphs can be serialized to a partiture that can be used as input for offline, online, or even distributed real-time scheduling. Finally we present results from a prototype analyzer that was used on a complete TCP/IP stack in addition to smaller test applications. The most surprising outcome is that increasing the expression of concurrency can reduce the level of parallelism required, saving memory on deeply embedded platforms.

Abstract : Deeply embedded systems often have unique constraints because of their small size and vital roles in critical infrastructure. Problems include limitations on code size, limited access to the actual hardware, {\em etc.} These problems become more critical in real-time systems where security policies must not only work within the above limitations but also ensure that task deadlines are not missed. A critical piece of information for security policies in real-time systems is the worst-case execution time (WCET) of the security code. This paper addresses some of the issues faced in the implementation of such security policies and also the process of determining WCETs for them. analysis safely bounds worst-case execution times to determine if tasks can meet their deadlines in hard real-time systems. However, conventional timing analysis requires that the upper bound of loops be known statically, which limits its applicability. Parametric timing analysis methods remove this constraint by providing the WCET as a formula parameterized on loop bounds.

Publication : Parametric Timing Analysis and its Application to DVS Authors : Sibin Mohan , Frank Mueller , William Hawkins , Michael Root , Christopher Healy , David Whalley and Emilio Vivancos . Abstract : Embedded Systems with real-time constraints depend on a-priori knowledge of worst-case execution times (WCETs) to determine if tasks meet deadlines. Static timing analysis derives bounds on WCETs but requires statically known loop bounds. This work removes the constraints on known loop bounds through parametric analysis expressing WCETs as functions. Tighter WCETs are dynamically discovered to exploit slack by dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) saving 60%-80% energy over DVS-oblivious techniques and showing savings close to more costly dynamic-priority DVS algorithms. Overall, parametric analysis expands the class of real-time applications to programs with loop-invariant dynamic loop bounds while retaining tight WCET bounds. Here is a link to the full paper .

Publication : ParaScale: Exploiting Parametric Timing Analysis for Real-Time Schedulers and Dynamic Voltage Scaling Authors : Sibin Mohan , Frank Mueller , William Hawkins , Michael Root , Christopher Healy and David Whalley . Abstract : Static timing analysis safely bounds worst-case execution times to determine if tasks can meet their deadlines in hard real-time systems. However, conventional timing analysis requires that the upper bound of loops be known statically, which limits its applicability. Parametric timing analysis methods remove this constraint by providing the WCET as a formula parameterized on loop bounds. This paper contributes a novel technique to allow parametric timing analysis to interact with dynamic real-time schedulers. By dynamically detecting actual loop bounds, a lower WCET bound can be calculated, on-the-fly, for the remaining execution of a task. We analyze thebenefits from parametric analysis in terms of dynamically discovered slack in a schedule. We then assess the potential for dynamic power conservation by exploiting parametric loop bounds for ParaScale, our intra-task dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) approach. Our results demonstrate that the parametric approach to timing analysis provides significant savings, close to 66 \%, in terms of slack as well as power. We further show that using this approach combined with online intra-task DVS to exploit parametric execution times results in much lower power consumption. Hence, even in the absence of dynamic scheduling, significant savings in power can be obtained, e.g. ,in the case of cyclic executives.

Publication : Timing Analysis for Sensor Network Nodes of the Atmega Processor Family. Authors : Sibin Mohan , Frank Mueller , David Whalley and Christopher Healy . Abstract : Low-end embedded architectures, such as sensor nodes, have become popular in diverse fields, many of which impose real-time constraints. Currently, the Atmel Atmega processor family used by Berkeley Motes lacks support for deriving safe bounds on the WCET, which is a prerequisite for performing real-time schedulability analysis. Our work fills this gap by providing an analytical method to obtain WCET bounds for this processor architecture. Our first contribution is to analyze both C and NesC code, the latter of which is unprecedented. The second contribution is to model control hazards and variable-cycle instructions, both handled more efficiently by our approach than by previous ones and results in up to 77% improvement in bounding the WCET. The results demonstrate that our timing analysis framework is able to tightly and safely estimate the WCET of the benchmarks while simulator results are shown to not always provide safe WCET bounds. While motivated by the Atmel Atmega series of processors, results are equally applicable to low-end embedded processors. This work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first set of experiments where timing results are contrasted from execution on an actual processor, from a cycle-accurate simulator and from a static timing analyzer. Furthermore, making our timing analysis toolset available to the Atmel Atmega processor family is a significant contribution towards addressing a documented need for tool support for sensor node architectures commonly used in networked systems of embedded computers, or so-called EmNets.

 Cyber Physical Systems Integration Lab Search Main menu Skip to primary content News Research Past Sponsors People About History and Accomplishments Internal Lui Sha http://cs.illinois.edu/people/faculty/lui-sha Lui Sha graduated with Phd. from CMU in 1985. He worked at the Software Engineering Institute from 1986 to 1998. He joined UIUC in 1998. Currently, he is Donald B. Gillies Chair Professor of Computer Science, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He was named Tau Beta Pi Daniel C. Drucker Eminent Faculty in 2017.He is a Fellow of ACM and IEEE and a recipient of IEEEs Simon Ramo medal, which honors exceptional achievement in systems engineering and systems science. IEEE Medals are the highest distinctions that the IEEE presents. Sha has led the creation of acomprehensive system engineering approach to design and build complex real-time systems, advancing the field from one using hand-crafted, trial-by-error processes into one that is a scientific engineering discipline. The approach, called Generalized Rate Monotonic Scheduling (GRMS) theory, developed with John Lehoczky and Raj Rajkumar, provides predictability, efficiency, and flexibility for scheduling complex concurrent real-time tasks. GRMS has become the best practice of the real-time computing industry, and is regularly taught in real time computing classes. Shas IEEE Fellow citation states, for technical leadership and research contributions which enabled the transformation of real-time computing practice from an ad hoc process to an engineering process based on analytic methods. From 2015-2017, Sha was appointed by Administrator of NASA, Charles Bolden, to the Aeronautics Committee of the NASA Advisory Council. He was selected for this council based largely his contribution to real-time computing and to complexity reduction and control architectures. The Simplex architecture allows the safe use of difficult or unverifiable complex control software. Its principles have been successfully used to improve the stability advanced avionics systems. Sha and his team invented the Physically Asynchronous Logically Synchronous (PALS) architecture. Steven P. Miller of Rockwell Collins Inc. demonstrated that, using PALS architecture, the model checking time of a dual redundant flight control system dropped from over 35 hours to less than 30 seconds. Sha and Millers team received the 2009 David Lubkowski Award for the Advancement of Digital Avionics from American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Examples of Research Impacts He is a widely cited author in real-time and embedded computing community. His work contributions to the development high technology systems include: Global Positioning Satellite : Contributions to the worldwide navigation. The navigation payload software for the next block of Global Positioning System upgrade recently completed testing. This design would have been difficult or impossible prior to the development of rate monotonic theory, L. Doyle, and J. Elzey Successful Use of Rate Monotonic Theory on A Formidable Real-Time System , technical report, p.1, ITT, Aerospace Communication Division, 1993. International Space Station : Through the development of Rate Monotonic Scheduling, we now have a system that will allow [Space Station]Fr eedoms computers to budget their time, to choose between a variety of tasks, and decide not only which one to do first but how mu ch time to spend i n the process , Aaron Cohen, Deputy Administrator of NASA, October 1992 (p. 3), Charting The Future: Challenges and Promises Ahead of Space Exploration. Mars Pathfinder : When was the last time you saw a room of people cheer a group of computer science theorists for their significant practical contribution to advancing human knowledge? It was quite a moment. For the record, the paper was L. Sha, R. Rajkumar, and J. P. Lehoczky. Priority Inheritance Protocols: An Approach to Real-Time Synchronization. In IEEE Transactions on Computers, vol. 39, pp. 1175-1185, Sep. 1990 . reported by Dr. Michael Jones in http:// catless . ncl .ac. uk /Risks/ 19.49.html Over the course of his career, he has also served as a member of the National Academy of Sciences committee on Certifiably Dependable Software, the peer review panel of Safety Critical Avionics Systems Branch at NASAs Langley Research Center, and the NSFs Planning Committee on Cyber Physical Systems on high assurance medical devices. Publications Education Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students, UIUC, 1999 and 2000 GE Scholar, the Academy for Excellence in Engineering Education, UIUC, 1999. For young researchers: Elements of Successful Research and How to Write Research Papers Current Projects Real Time Multicore Computing Single Core Equivalence : Each core in a multicore chip can be used and certified as if it were a single core chip, allowing Virtual Single Core : A set of cores of a multicore chip can be used as if it were a large single core chip. The recent research focus on modern high performance CPU-GPU real-time computing architecture. Real-time Virtual Synchrony: A networked avionic system can be programed as if it were a perfectly synchronized system under the Physically asynchronous Logically Synchronous (PALS) protocol.For dual redundant flight control system, the verification time without PALS is over 35 hours. Using PALS, the verification time dropped to less than 30 seconds, winning the David Lubkowski award for the Advancement of Digital Avionics from American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Medical Best Practice Guidance (GPS) Systems In 1999, the challenge of preventable medical errors was first raised in a landmark study by the American Medical Association: To Err is Human . This study reported that at least 44,000 people, and perhaps as many as 98,000 people, die in hospitals each year as a result of medical errors that could have been prevented . In 2013 Journal of Patient Safety reported that more than 400,000 people die every year because of preventable medical errors. The negative economic impact was estimated at a colossal $1 trillion per year in a US Senate hearing in 2014 . Preventable medical errors are not a medical knowledge problem. It is a medical cyber-physical system challenge in the form of medical information and workflow management challenge, where the medical devices, doctors, nurses, and technicians have to work together flawlessly in real-time. Like how GPS revolutionized navigation, Medical Best Practice System will revolutionize clinical practices. Currently, we are working with Carle Foundation Foundation Hospital and with OSF Illinois Childrens Hospital in the research and development of medical best practice systems. The Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Guidance System has entered Phase II evaluation at Carle ICU. We also completed the initial prototypes of Sepsis Guidance System. Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Guidance System Review Medical staff with the assistance of the guidance systems will achieve: More rapid and accurate identification of critical changes of patient conditions, More rapid and consistent entry of vital information Fit into current clinical workflow, Stricter adherence to up-to-date standardized medical treatment guidelines and protocols, Improved team effectiveness, and Reduced medical errors from an altered sense of time and memory lapses ( due to high stress ). Carle Foundation Hospital: Karen White, M.D., Vasantha Reddi, Ph.D. Pediatric Sepsis Guidance System Prototype Review Computerized Guidance System will: Assist clinicians with early detection of pediatric sepsis by providing real-time assistance with clinical management of pediatric sepsis Facilitate continued assessment of septic children while providing feedback on next steps in management and Improve adherence to accepted practice standards for management of pediatric sepsis Early vascular access and timeliness of fluid administration Improved rates of antibiotic administration within 60 minutes of presentation Serve as resource to teach less experienced clinicians and clinicians-in-training important tenants of pediatric sepsis management Serve as a tool for simulation-based training and in situ training OSF Childrens Hospital of Illinois & JUMP: Richard Pearl, M.D., Jonathon Gehlbach, M.D. Positions Available Part-time jobs in the lab: software development and/or hardware device interfaces Recent Posts New Initiative: Engineering Next Generation Medical Systems Posted on April 1, 2013 by Admin We have started a new initiative towards safe and effective medical systems.

Search this site Sinha Laboratory @ UIUC Menu About Us Lab News People Publications Research Overview Sinha's Home Software Support Sinha Laboratory @ UIUC About Us Welcome to the laboratory of Saurabh Sinha at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Our research focuses on computational approaches to problems in molecular biology. In particular, we are interested in exploring gene regulation, mostly in metazoan genomes, and in the biological contexts of development, behavior and cancer. We approach the subject through an integrated analysis of DNA sequence, gene expression, and epigenetic data. We also strive to understand how sequences involved in gene regulation have evolved. Broadly speaking, our work falls in the areas of regulatory and comparative genomics . Principal Investigator : Saurabh Sinha.

 Hari Sundaram University of Illinois About Me Research Publications Teaching Contact & Meet Me Hari Sundaram Hari Sundaram is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and in the Advertising Departments at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research, motivated by the challenge of "persuading millions of people to adopt behaviors (e.g. adopt healthy lifestyles) that would be beneficial to them,'' lies at the intersection of social network analysis and computational advertising. Analyzing the question of behavioral change at massive scale, requires us to develop new theoretical frameworks, design algorithms, build scalable systems and perform field experiments. His research has won awards from the ACM and IEEE societies.

 Hello, Friend. My name is Matus Telgarsky . I am an assistant professor at UIUC . I received my PhD at UCSD in 2013 under Sanjoy Dasgupta . I study mathematical aspects of machine learning. Current interests. Approximation/representation power of deep networks. I proved there exist deep networks which can only be approximated by shallower networks if they have exponentially as many nodes ( arXiv , video , lecture notes one and two ), and continue to work on related questions (e.g., rational functions , and generative networks (with Bolton Bailey) ). Generalization of deep networks. The empirically-observed excess risk correlates with the Lipschitz constant of networks, and yields a generalization bound ( arXiv , poster , video ). Optimization and implicit regularization of deep networks. In grad school I studied AdaBoost, and found that taking the step size to 0 leads to margin maximization ( arXiv ). Ziwei Ji and I have been studying margin maximization for deep networks, first proving it for logistic regression ( arXiv ), and then for deep linear networks ( arXiv ). Other interests. In the past I focused on boosting and clus te ring ; in the future i hope to study reinforcement learning. Teaching. Machine learning theory (CS 598 TEL): fall 2019, fall 2018 , fall 2017, fall 2016. Machine learning (CS 446): spring 2019 , spring 2018. Miscellaneous. I have two glorious PhD students: Bolton Bailey , Ziwei Ji . My research is funded by an NSF CAREER award , and an NVIDIA GPU grant. During summer 2019 I am co-organizing a Simons Institute summer program on deep learning ; I was also at the Simons Institute during Spring 2017 . I co-founded the Midwest ML Symposium (MMLS) and moreover co-chaired the 2017 and 2018 editions, all together with glorious Po-Ling Loh . I have a degree in violin performance from Juilliard , but hardly play any more . I coded a screensaver , a 3-d plotting tool , and a few other things if you know where to look. My desk is always messy . I like scifi books, pencils , ramen , and aphex twin .

Errata are posted as I find them. The image of the Monterey Cypress is there because of the NSF-funded CIPRES project , whose purpose was to develop the methods and computational infrastructure to improve large-scale phylogeny estimation. Why I wrote this book . Research Positions Available: I have openings in my group for graduate students (PhD or MS) to work on developing computational methods for large-scale multiple sequence alignment, phylogeny estimation, metagenomics, and even historical linguistics. Strong programming skills, mathematical intuition, and interest in collaboration are necessary. If you are already a graduate student at UIUC, please contact me directly. If you are interested in applying to UIUC for graduate school and would like to work with me, please read this first and then contact me. Unfortunately, I do not have any funding available for postdoctoral researchers. However, if you have your own source of funds and have published papers directly related to my research, I'll be glad to talk with you about working together. (If you are an undergraduate , please see this page .) Current Funding : Multiple sequence alignment , funded by NSF grant ABI-1458652, beginning August 2015. This project will develop new methods for multiple sequence alignment, building on our SAT, PASTA, and UPP methods. Metagenomics , funded by NSF grant III:AF:1513629.

I am particularly interested in building such intelligent systems for improving health, medical care, education, and accelerating scientific discovery , and bulding them based on theoretically sound frameworks, models, and algorithms that are also effective empirically. My current interests include Intelligent Information Retrieval , Text Data Mining , Applied Machine Learning , Optimization of Human-Computer Collaboration , Biomedical and Health Informatics , and Intelligent Educational Systems . For a more detailed view of my research interests, you may want to take a look at the slides of some of my recent talks .
